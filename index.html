      <h3 id="headline">Key dates in Robin Holliday's life</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Robin was born on 6 November <strong>1932</strong> in Jaffa.
        </li>
        <li>After schooling in Gibraltar and Hitchin he went up to Cambridge and gained a double first in Natural Sciences. 
          He stayed at Cambridge for PhD studies on the genetics of Ustilago maydis. 
        </li>
        <li>From<strong> 1958-65</strong> he held a research position at the John Innes Institute in Bayfordbury, Hertfordshire, 
          and also spent one year (1962-3) on a Fulbright Scholarship in the Department of Genetics at the University of Washington 
          in Seattle.
        </li>
        <li>Robin joined the staff of NIMR in <strong>1965</strong>, researching microbial genetics and subsequently the mechanism 
          of biological ageing. The then Director, Peter Medawar, was keen to establish a “little nucleus of bacterial geneticists” to 
          work alongside the Institute’s bacterial chemists at that time. One referee who Medawar consulted said <span id="referee">“There can be no 
          doubt of [his] ingenuity and enterprise … He must be making more progress with the study of replication and recombination than
          virtually anyone else”.</span> Three years later Medawar wrote that Robin Holliday had “added to his reputation by his more
          recent work on DNA repair mechanisms and by his exciting experiments in the field of senescence”.
        </li>
        <li>He was appointed head of a new Division of Genetics in 1970 and by <strong>1974</strong> was described as “one of the more 
          outstanding members of the Institute”.
        </li>
        <li>He made discoveries that came to have central importance to the field of epigenetics. In <strong>1975</strong> he suggested 
          that <span id="main-work">DNA methylation could be an important mechanism for the control of gene expression in higher organisms, and this has now
          become documented as a basic epigenetic mechanism in normal and cancer cells.</span>
        </li>
        <li>He was elected FRS in <strong>1976</strong> and later received many other honours.
        </li>
        <li>In <strong>1988</strong> Robin left NIMR and took up a senior research position with CSIRO in Sydney, Australia.
        </li>
        <li>He retired from research in <strong>1997</strong>.
        </li> 
        <li>Robin Holliday died on <strong>9 April 2014</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>He was awarded the Royal Society’s Royal Medal in 2011 for his influential discoveries of the ‘Holliday junction’
      molecular structure (formed whenever the breakage and rejoining of DNA occurs in chromosomes, such as in cell division)
      and the function of DNA methylation (a process vital for normal development in humans, in which DNA is chemically
      modified).</p>
